Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan, in terms of economic ties which he seeks to strengthen with the third largest economy in the world.
Plans for greater nuclear co-operation are high on agenda.
According to reports India is also hoping for a treaty on defence collaboration between the two nations.
Police in Karratha arrest 20-year-old after high speed motorcycle chase.
A motorcycle has been seized after it was ridden at 125km/h in a 70km/h zone and through bushland to escape police in the Pilbara.
Traffic policemen in Karratha this morning tried to make a blue motorcycle stop, after they spotted it reaching 125km/h as it left a service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the rider then got the stopsignal ignored and continued on to Burgess Road before turning into bushland, where the officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person, which matches the description of the rider, was then at a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra spotted.
Police in Karratha have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to obey a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is due to, on September 23 in Magistrates Court of Karratha, appear.
The motorcycle was seized and for three months impounded.

George Webster, 28, during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow, faced the charges.
He is accused that on June 7, 2013 a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire was raped by him.
It is claimed that, Webster attacked her, while she was "unconscious, asleep and incapable of giving consent."
Webster is then charged, on May 4, 2014, with getting a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn in the Highlands raped.
Judge Lady Rae set a trial date for November 17 at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Reconnecting with the very american Ideal of Labor Rights as Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation, which treats union organizing as a civil right and to protect.
"As unions go, so go middle-class jobs," says Ellison, the Democrat from Minnesota and a Progressive Caucus co-chair in Congress.
So I’m proud to introduce, with civil rights icon John Lewis, the Employee Empowerment Act.
This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options in case of discrimination for union organizing as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces.
Amend of the National Labor Relations Act, by which opportunities for workers who suffer discrimination to organize trade union representatives, to sue for justice in civil court can be provided - and compensatory and punitive damages can be collected - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is with certainty not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the cosponsors of their legislation are proposing, is a reconnection with a very American idea.
Despite the reverse, that unions have in recent years taken - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world that labor rights should be recognized, extended and respected.
There was a time, that millions of Americans still remember, when in this country democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right were mentioned in the same breath.
When the United States after World War II got Japan occupied, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his aides encouraged the country to make a constitution, which should assure that militarized autocracy of Hideki Tojo would be replaced with democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions had, in shaping the new Japan, a role to play, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed."
When the United States after World War II got Germany occupied, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution, that would assure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy.
Recognizing the truth, that workers would need to organize and make their voices in the new nation heard, the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared: "The right to form associations for working and economic conditions securing and improving shall be, to every individual and to every occupation or profession, guaranteed.
Agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be null and void; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, by which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, as it was in 1948 by the United Nations adopted as a global covenant, Roosevelt and the other drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right, with which trade unions for the protection of his interests can be formed and joined."
For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As this country counseled other countries on how civil and democratic societies could be forged, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and for this trade union, then in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies, to get engaged - had to be protected.
With those rights in America under assault, it is indeed wise to get the American ideal reminded, that working people must have a right to unite and in a free and open society to make their voices heard.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said :
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not the strength of the nation diminish but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions, labor had miraculously a market for industry created and the whole nation to undreamed of production-levels lifted.
Those who have labor attacked forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, as should we.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of protections of civil rights as protection to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that in America have historically made it great and delivered the real promise of democracy .
Judge blocks temporarily law that could make all abortion clinics in Louisiana closed.
A U.S. federal judge blocked on Sunday temporarily enforcement of a law Louisiana that advocates say would likely have all five abortion clinics in the state closed.
The measure, signed by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June into law and due to take effect Sept. 1, would require doctors who perform abortions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's ruling means, however, that doctors for the time being can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges.
"Plaintiffs will be allowed to lawfully operate, while for their efforts to obtain privileges, continuing," wrote federal Judge John deGravelles in the decision.
Within a month there will be a hearing scheduled for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .  
Abortion rights activists applauded the decision , the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures , saying doctors have more time by which hospital privileges can be obtained.   
"Today's ruling ensures women in Louisiana are safe from an underhanded law that seeks, them of their health and rights, to strip," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued, on behalf of three of the state's five clinics, to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling, to doctors from the two clinics, applied who were in the suit not plaintiffs and have also applied for admitting privileges.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have similar laws passed, with courts recently ruling such measures in Alabama and Mississippi as unconstitution.
Key parts of a law in Texas that would have shuttered most, in that state, remaining clinics were by a federal judge on Friday blocked.
Abortion rights campaigners, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.
Abortion opponents have countered that the measures aim to protect health of women, though some have also their effect of shuttering clinics lauded.
Only one doctor who in Louisiana performs abortions has hospital admitting privileges, said the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop more abortions-performing, that doctor, fearful for his safety, would stop carrying out the procedure, said the group.
In arguing against the ruling, said Louisiana officials, that they would not get doctors who perform abortions punished, while their applications for admitting privileges were pending.
Delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment lead to increased mortality from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have a video tribute to their late mother posted, who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia have a higher risk, for ovarian cancer dying, than urban women. 
Researchers analysed medical records of more than 1100 Australian women, who in 2005 with ovarian cancer diagnosed, finding just 25 percent for five years after diagnosis were lived.
Researcher leader Susan Jordan, of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said those living in regional and remote areas of the state have a risk of death during the study for about 20 percent higher than those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs may get lung, ovarian cancer slow
The researchers tracked the medical journeys of these women across seven years.
Dr Jordan said age of a woman at the time of diagnosis,type of ovarian cancer, having existing illnesses and socio-economic status also have, on survival chances, impacted.
Older women and those whose cancer was at the time of diagnosis more advanced had the poorest survival rates.
Those, in regional and remote areas of the state, living, have a risk of death during the study for 20 percent higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why outside the city living women were, from ovarian cancer, more likely to die, suggested by Dr Jordan, that delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors.
"This disease is best, by gynaecological oncology surgeons, treated and they're mostly based in major cities," she said.
Despite improving tele-medicine services to get the tyranny of distance lessened, she suggested, as a possible remedy, an enhancement of the services of airlift doctors to give specialists possibility to treat women closer to home and programs to support treatment for people away from their communities.
Dr. Jordan said the study found regardless of geographic status poor long-term survival in women with ovarian cancer and underscored the need for better treatment and nurse strategies.
The Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer-funded study will be, today in the Medical Journal of Australia, published.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 from the Gold Coast, learned she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under 35, could see garden centers lose tens of thousands of pounds a year as today's young consumers according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "core age group for garden products,"
The report says, renters spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with their own homes spend on their gardens.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting front gardens for parking purposes and declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, which has an estimated £5 billion annual in sales.
Greater London, where over a period of 6-year homeownership has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, reports the lowest spending on garden products per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens doesn't mean people can't grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS said, "Container gardening, for example, is very popular with renters because they can take their plants with them when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail gardening due to increasing homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted this year an improved market situation due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
Led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri, the protest movement in Pakistan continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 protesters stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers were able to push the protesters again out of PTV building, however.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but has since resumed broadcasting.
Meanwhile, about 3000 demonstrators tried to make their way to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 
About a kilometer away, they engaged in clashes with, with sticks and stones armed, security forces.
The police used tear gas.
Protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but this was refused.
The country's army has called meanwhile for a political solution to the conflict, "without time-wasting and without force-using". 
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced, "The army remains by its role committed to ensure the security of the state."
The army plays in Pakistan an important role and have been more frequent coups.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in parliamentary election last May.
Protests had escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
There were three people killed.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report.
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has summoned the most senior U.S. diplomat of the country for information on a report about American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the chargé d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as online magazine The Intercept reported that former U.S. analyst of National Security Agency Edward Snowden shows that Turkey was a major area of activity for U.S. and British intelligence agencies.
According to information from Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were mutual spying.
An earlier report that also main intelligence agency of Germany was targeting Ankara prompted much angrier reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: train drivers threaten consequences for commuters.
The nationwide warning strike by train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The walkout, announced for 6 to 9 p.m, affects nationwide all transportation companies, including long-distance, regional and commuter rail services,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.

said the district chairman of the Union of German Locomotive Drivers (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We are expecting significant deficit.
No regional focal points.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight transport.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced, everything possible to do to get the impact minimized.
The GDL, however, has not said where it wants to strike, so it is difficult for the consequences to concretely predict.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
Prosecutors presented on Friday to the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorca, with evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The chief police from Calvià on the vacation island of Mallorca has been arrested following corruption allegations by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge-drinking-hotspot of Magaluf.
Chief Superintendent José Antonio Navarro was remanded, after corruption allegations against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, in custody.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, claimants presented to the Office of Prosecutor for the Anti-Corruption of Mallorca on Friday, with evidence of extortion by police and employees in the city of Calvica.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and will be questioned with Navarro by a judge along.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the disgruntled nightclub owners testified that the nepotism of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," told by one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our livelihood out of it.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf, over the summer for a viral YouTube video, made international headlines, which showed an 18-year-old British tourist performing oral sex on 24 men during a drinking tour. 
Island authorities have since tried to stop the disorderly behavior of alcoholic vacationers in Magaluf by getting the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-soaked pub crawls minimized.
The Playhouse club where the fellatio incident took place has been forced for a year to close, while Playhouse and pub crawl organizer Carnage are jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially with young British vacationers popular, is also known for quite a few drunk-driving accidents, including the trend of "balconing," where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
First spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Airport Adelaide
SPRING has given South Australia a wintry surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights out of Airport Adelaide.
This evening by 9 pm, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, following 6.6mm that had already at sunday night fallen.
The latest precipitation was the result of a series of brief, blustery showers, including a downpour that began just before 8 p.m. and nearly 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes was provided.
After winter of last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city on Monday dropped again to a high of just 15.8 degrees.
Gusty weather conditions likely led to the delayed landing of a flight of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft should have landed shortly after 7:30 pm, but got a wind shear hit - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and must take off through.
Wind gusts reached at this time about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
Flight data showed that the aircraft also had to go through a second landing approach and finally touched down at about 8:40 pm.
The flight delay delayed subsequently several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide on Tuesday, a high temperature of 16°C is forecast, with possible showers.
Matthies thinks: High time for great networking
In the face of galloping technical progress which threatens to turn our cozy homes into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies consoles himself with an exceedingly familiar electronic accessory.
As I'm writing this, my eyes fall on the coiled cord, which gets the handset to the phone connected, and I think: Wow, how retro is that?
But this behind is a consideration: If the cable was not there, in no time, all the handsets would be rederless flying around the house, and that would be significantly more retro.
Anyway, on the ekeltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing error: electronic) sector of the rule, that world novelty today is e-waste tomorrow, bought - obsolete.
And anyone who, for example, today still has a tube TV in their living room, is simply saying that they reject television fundamentally.
Why these considerations?
 src: Because the throng of Ifa on Funkturm this week once again showed us our absolute incompetence on issues of electronics. 
The layman who used to be able to control a washing machine and CD player blindly does not even understand the purpose of the devices that, with inconceivably vain expert talk, are spread out before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" is for us a promise by the press office.
Yes, working still?
What is there to talk about with people who voluntarily seem to spout such baloney?
Basically, the main thing, for the last 20 years or so, has been that we should get our house network.
So that the yogurt will itself reorder, so that the fire alarm tells us on vacation in the Maldives that in the study is a fire breaking out
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could, from the office, set the air conditioner for our imminent arrival ...?
Yes, that requires, however, air conditioning.
But one dream will definitely soon come true: We lift our watches, tell it loudly "Vacuum!" - and at home the vacuum cleaning robot drives off.
Lunatic.
All this amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurring," murmurs one industry insider. You can get your washing machine to a pair of headphones connected, your steamer sends the weather forecast, and the data glasses show how long the pizza will take in the oven, was however useless because we're stuck in traffic.
From daily practice, we also know that when a newfangled device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be flat.
Which is another reason why the coiled cable on the phone will, until the next IFA exhibitions, survive.
Israeli children return, after war in Gaza, to their schools
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned, on Monday, to schools after they spent the summer in bomb shelters while rocket and mortar fire on their communities rained down during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and schools in Gaza remained closed while the territory recovered from the fighting.
The school-start brought, scarred by rocket shell holes, communities in southern Israel a sense of joy and expectation to, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed, before the arrival of the students, shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls.
"We're a little scared, but excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and over there English teacher.
Many children from our area need desperately a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a little weird", suddenly to school going back.
"Those were difficult times, and we completely didn't leave the house," said her.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the border of Gaza, tending with his support to offer.
Until a ceasefire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes, tending to safer areas further from Gaza to move, from rocket and mortar fire to escape.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border of Gaza where a 4-year-old boy was, by a Palestinian mortar shell, killed, are still hesitant for the return.
The Education Ministry said about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children have been, temporarily in other schools, placed.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that is heavily by Palestinian shelling scarred.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure, that knowledge for you will be acquired and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite ceasefire.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting; Important issues remain, however, unresolved, such as demand of Hamas for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands disarm from Hamas and deliver of the bodies of two, killed in the fighting, Israeli soldiers.
A new round of indirect talks is expected, later this month in Egypt, to begin.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them were civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimate from Palestinian and UN.
Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, but provided no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting at Israeli towns, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other strikes.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought in more than 100 UN schools refuge that were into temporary shelters converted.
While tens of thousands of people continue in shelters to live and fighting continues, education authorities postponed last week the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will be soon again open so we can continue learning like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy which currently in a school in Gaza City lived.
After election in Saxony: CDU vice president Strobl questions NPD ban proceedings
In view of the loss of votes of NPD in Saxony, CDU federal deputy leader Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD scores worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU state leader in Baden-Württemberg, the Leipziger Volkszeitung.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that leads me rather to the conclusion that the NPD should be politically fought and not before the constitutional court.
The NPD failed, in the vote on Sunday, to pass narrowly the 5 percent threshold. 
A first attempt to ban the right-wing extremist party in 2003 failed because the Constitution Protection Office had in the NPD leadership informants.
In December 2013, the Bundesrat, after long preparation, submitted a new application to Karlsruhe.
Federal government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, Refugees are now being in tents housed.
The Central Initial Reception for Refugees in Harburg is at the seams bursting.
Now the Interior Ministry has set up three tents of Red Cross next to it. 
The district politicians were only shortly informed beforehand - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These call-out actions continue to fuel reservations of citizens and do not give district politicians the opportunity to work constructively on the humane accommodation of refugees," says, for example, Britta Herrmann, parliamentary group leader of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly.
Your party demands that the district administration of Harburg make currently unused houses available for housing.
96 refugees can be, in the three tents, accommodated.
The reasons for overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of seeking-help people - and the fact that the authorities cannot get enough places in follow-up facilities provided.
Many refugees stay therefore longer than the regular three months.
Housing prices have experienced the sharpest winter rise in seven years, showed by a widely watched index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for private housing in the Australian capital city rose in August 1.1 percent, showed by RP data on Monday.
This increase brings the total increase in June, July and August to 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months ending August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
Research director of RP Data Tim Lawless shared that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a bifurcated market.
Figures from RP Data show that housing prices in Sydney last year rose 16.1 percent, while Melbourne's were up by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been, by cuts in government spending, hit hard and where prices rose over the year by just 1.4 percent.
Mr. Lawless said further that with the spring-start now upon us, for the next few months, there would be an uptick in for-sale properties, which would have the market "a real test" given.
"When people considered the continued high rate of auction prices, a generally rapid sales-rate and the continued low interest rate environment, it is likely that housing prices will over the next three months continue to rise," opined him.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements by managing director Peer Medau and attests to the latter, "like a commander" to pose.
The style of university can not be this, said in a notification.
Thus the family Medau had already, "in the middle of June verbally about the request of the university, been informed.
"The statement that the plans only in July became known are definitely false," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
Even the necessary expansion of the narrow road leading to the castle, is not as dramatic as Medaus feared. 
There was and is, of a nine-meter-wide road, no talk.
"As it stands, talking about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators, that their free and school-owned parking areas in the future will then only by students of the university be used, is for Pötzl unacceptable.
src: Parking is not an issue at all because, as with other public parking spaces, it can now intelligently be solved.
Thinking of the residents
The Bergwichtel daycare center, which is located on the site and in front of whose front door the access road to the parking deck would run along, according to the university president, "should not be affected."
Rather, he points out, "this is not just about the nursery, but also about the residents at the junction with Friedrich-Streib-Strasse and the 800 pupils at the neighboring secondary school.
"So it's about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' association of the nursery, with the development of the road one "of the few natural spots of Coburg would be lost" is justified, "it can by the reader himself decided."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Authority of Bamberg, wants to get the city councils about the structural development of the university until 2020 informed "and in this context get the importance of the new development addressed."
Peer Medau had informed last week parents of the nursery about the plans of university.
According to this, the access for the new parking deck will not be as before via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Strasse, but via Medau-Berg.
This would mean that the narrow road about one-kilometer length would have, to two lanes, to be widened.
According to projections by Medaus, this would increase traffic in the park at Hohenfels Castle tenfold.
About 2000 vehicles a day is the hearsay.
In terms of city, people has so far declined to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national-team
Holger Glandorf will no longer, for the DHB team, play.
The 31-year-old from Bundesliga team SG Flensburg-Handewitt explained his decision mainly causatively as health problems.
The decision was for me not easy, it matured over several months.
"It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the World Champion 2007 shared on his Facebook page.
He enters thus, with a record of 167 caps and 576 goals for Germany, international retirement .
Because the powerful back-rower wants to, for the Champions League winners from Flensburg for a few more years, continue scoring, he is now, for the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson, no longer available.
With the Icelander, who on Tuesday will select his squad for the games against Switzerland, Glandorf said he had had a "nice long talk".
His ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me, as I am sure they will also inspire my long-term teammates and my successors.
"But for my club, I would also like to be available in the next few years in good health and that requires longer breaks and more recovery time, and the current double burden wouldn`t allow me to do that."
The left-hander had, in 2012 when he had a heel infection, feared his career might end.
Due to achilles tendon problems he was, by doctors working with the German Handball Association, given a cortisone injection, and this caused severe swelling of his foot.
He needed an emergency operation and two further surgeries as well.
Glandorf then brought a legal action against the team doctor; however, this ended with a settlement.
Twelve years as a professional and eleven years with the national team would take their toll on any player.
"I have some health issues, which I no longer can ignore.
After three foot-surgeries caused by infections within a short period of time in 2012, I have never been able to control my blood pressure.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year I realized that I was able to control my head, but I couldn`t play tricks with my body," he explained in an interview with German magazine Handball Time.
For a comeback, he would only consider if really necessary.
"If we are in real big trouble, then I might consider it," the father of two told the magazine.
"But I can count the years I will continue to play handball with one hand.
I must also say that I, after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, also have really become humble, as far as my health is concerned.
After my career, to be honest, I would like to walk straight."
Besides the World Championship in 2007 and wining the Champions League in 2014, he won in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF-Cup.
In 2012, he also won with Flensburg the European Cup Winners' Cup.
German economy, by 0.2 percent in spring, has shrunk
The crises around the globe have, the German economy in the second quarter, slowed down.
The Gross Domestic Product sank from April to the end of June 2014 in comparison with the previous quarter by 0.2 percent.
This was announced by the German Office for National Statistics, which thereby confirmed previous estimates.
Consumption alone was a spur to the economy in the early part of the year, whilst investments were down.
Also, foreign goods trade slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, this results in, for the first half of the year overall, a GDP up 0.8 percent from the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of "Münsterland-Mooiste", which on Sunday for the first time lead through the Burgmann city.
The city Burgmann Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "Fietzen riders".
The largest cycling federation in Netherlands, NTFU, staged the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
In other words, the largest bike ride straight through Münsterland, a bike riders' paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne, with their registration, for the organization of this tour through Münsterland.
Advertised in several professional journals, the tour was offered to those interested.
We are from Den Helder, and drove here over night so we could take part in the tour.
We would also like to get know Münsterland a bit better in the same way", the cyclists eagerly said, looking forward to the route through Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering at the fraternity's club house, Sta.
Katharina started off with a small "peace ride" through the city and over the embankment, which is also where the start line was.
Then, the route, which was advertised in three different categories, headed in the direction of Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld, passing by Havixbeck and Billerbeck, and then back to Horstmar.
On stretches of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the riders just prove how good a shape they are in.
They were fed and watered on their way back in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer, Jos ter Huerne, and deputy mayor, Heinz Lölfing seemed, with the success of this cycling event, to be very pleased.
We are happy, and it was a wonderful experience for all participants.
The organization went smoothly, with no issues, and there were no nasty incidents", Heinz Lölfing positively concluded with regard to the event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer hoped for, which is presumably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We shall see each other in 2015, hopefully with nice weather, on either 30 August, or on another weekend", the riders promised, but whatever the weather, they will return to Münsterland, and the organizers will plan a repeat.
Konstantin Wecker - scrupulously honest memoirs
It is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a biography, what Konstantin Wecker, song writer, pacifist, political activist and ex-prisoner in "Monk and Warrior" has put on paper on 287 pages.
Rather than a chronological history, composed more as a collection of thought-provoking ideas, the author, who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947, has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable song-text.
And he has been unstintingly honest throughout: From masturbating as a grammar school pupil to shoplifting and drug-taking, he has left none of his human weaknesses untold.
And this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so tolerant towards his fellow man.
As a result, abstract concepts, which he liberally uses throughout the text, take on a clearer, more important meaning: Love; Soul; Ego; Existing in the Here and Now; Spirituality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts, in a highly philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he explains why he is pacifist; what lies behind his criticism of society; his political heart and soul; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and moulded - not only by music (he was an opera lover who became a soul and rock musician) but by his prison experience, too.
That latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the monks, who live their lives by a process of "subtraction" as he says "by ridding themselves of everything unnecessary."
In-between all the highbrow stuff, there are also short anecdotes of a more earthy nature - for example, fist-fights in a bar frequented by GIs, or else a crazy drive on the motorway, in which he drove full-on straight into a tree.
Also, there, he is unsparingly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me into his arms.
Has never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood.
He attended "a lot" of therapy after the death of his mother and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.
He was very unknowable.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: 'Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass, the beauty of the stroke in cricket.
I never had a conversation with him like that.
He was this unsmiling bloke in the corner, reading the paper for a lot of my life.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he got a snapshot of what life must have been like for him.
It's now a bit brighter, but they're dark, smoky, deep stygian mazes with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.
My dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you'd hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him.
When I walked round it, I realized that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table, and my estimation of him went up.
None the less, Henry grew up as a child without any expressions of love from his parents.
My dad never did hugging, never said, 'I love you'.
It wasn't until my mum was near the end of her life feeling unwell, we began to say 'I love you, I love you, I love you.
Having a daughter of his own, Billie, with Dawn French, enabled him to share the love he missed as a child.
Could you with the "I love you" stop?
Will you stop giving me a hug!
Dad, I am 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mum.
He's still very good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mum.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetic started showing, said my doctor, “You have to be radical”.
So I went on a big fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very hard.
And it is tedious.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's change in career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his distinguished, close-cropped beard.
Since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has become engrossed in the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life.
He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him.
His TV career began in the mid-Seventies: "I was, for quite a long time, the only black impressionist/comedian on television."
He learnt on the job.
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, but from 1975 to 1985 I had to learn how to be an efficient joke-telling machine, whilst being a star, being on television and it was really difficult.
Lenny in 1975 on New Faces
Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.
My family was about this very uncomfortable.
I sort of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a weird, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on huge projects and learning how to handle a large audience.
But this "long-standing award-winning light entertainment staple of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Introducing characters who both lampooned and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on the alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show went in 1984 on the air, and in the Nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his 2008 BBC series, LennyHenry.tv, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels a bit like you're marking time or you're slightly going sideways."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I wasn't really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage down the front.
So I was very frightened of it.
Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.
Do not denigrate it, if you don't know what you're talking about.
Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It's almost like I had my head, finally properly placed for me.
This is what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, research a bit.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I was reading that play for months and months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed a car crash is likely, and it didn't quite happen.
And soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I just couldn't quite believe it.
There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.""
There was a technical fault and Henry felt instinctively that he had to keep the audience entertained.
"A little voice told me, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they have the computer fixed.""
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God".
I am not responsible for that.
I can let somebody else sort it out.
You're in a play, so stay in character."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning his lines for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it stiffens the sinews.
Also, that went down well, so it's like a big sign from the gods, saying, 'This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a THUNDEROUS voice.
So I am going to stick with that.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry still has a brain of a comedian, though - throughout, our conversation is broken with flashes of his humor as he slips in and out of impressions.
I have decided no more stand-up comedy making, because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of strangers I guess is kind of dangerous.
If you keep looking for that, it can lead to a brick wall.
I perform sometimes Live at the Apollo when I want to, but generally it doesn’t give me as much as it used to.
I ask whether he was ever going to have another stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.
So, is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's good fun.
You're always telling a story and that's a great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemeni capital
In the conflict between the shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemen government, the Houthis have, for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa, called.
Houthi supporters had on Monday occupied central roads in Sanaa, said a spokesman of the Houthi party "Ansar Allah."
Also, access road to the parliament was blocked.
Yemeni media report that there is traffic chaos in the capital.
According to a report in the on-line edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had on Sunday evening, for these actions, called.
Huthi threatened, according to a report, with a further escalation of the conflict, should his demands not be met.
The shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from the sunni-ruled Yemen, and are demanding the resignation of the government.
This tribe of Houthi has been, for almost two weeks, besieging the Yemeni capital.
Around 30,000 rebels have, protest camps on the major access routes to Sanaa, set up.
In the surrounding areas of the town, there have been repeated bloody clashes with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers civil servants to target 'ghost workers'
Kenya has started all civil servants biometrical registration, in an attempt for "ghost workers" in the government's payroll to be removed.
Employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid, said a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people after leaving the civil service continue to receive salaries.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged, after taking office in 2013, to curb corruption in the public service.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month, in payments to "ghost workers" and other financial malpractice, was lost.
The government suspects that salaries continue, into bank accounts, to be deposited, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for BBC from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are required over the next two weeks at identification centers to present themselves to ensure their data through the biometric registration exercise is captured, was in a government statement announced.
Anyone who did not do so without a valid excuse would be, from the payroll, eliminated, as the statement continues.
"This exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of 'ghost workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.
The scandal surrounding arts advisor, Helge Achenbach, will be on 11 November for the first time in court, be heard.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the founder of Aldi, Theo Albrecht, are suing in a civil case brought before the Düsseldorf district court, 19.4 million euros compensation from Achenbach and two of his companies, who are in the process of declaring themselves bankrupt.
The news was announced by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
According to the statement of claim, Achenbach have, when purchasing the works of art and antique cars, had them scammed, and had Berthold Albrecht for more than the actual sales price, issued invoice.
In so doing, the agreed commission was also higher as a result.
Achenbach had valuables for 121 million euros for Albrecht, purchased.
Children need roots and wings
For 44 years, was he a school teacher, 23 of which he was the principal.
During his teaching time, Manfred Richter got to know many schoolchildren living in Petershausen and Kollbach who are now fully-grown adults.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but they were always based on his desire, so in the students adult can be seen.
Mount Sněžka is one of the best-known peaks in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves this painting with the motif of his childhood home.
Richter was in 1930, in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, birthed, today's Trutnov.
As early as the age of 14, he was interested, after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years, in becoming a teacher.
One year later were the Germans living in the Sudetenland dispossessed.
Within half an hour, must the family from their home vacate.
After a few months in a holding camp, moved they in 1946 to Bavaria - in a goods train.
That was what brought Richter in Upper Franconia in Senkendorf.
The teacher training course was in Bamberg.
In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week to the nearest train station on foot; take the train to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometers right across the town to the school; and then returns in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given, at the Red Cross Home in Bamberg, a bed to sleep, that he shared with 15 fellow students in a sleeping quarter.
In 1951, he took his first, and in 1954, after spending three years as a trainee teacher, his second state examination.
Since Upper Franconia, for him, had no free teaching place, he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on November 1, 1954 at a school in Kollbach.
The "Young Women's Room" was his first "Service Flat" in the school building.
In 1958, he moved in the newly built teacher accommodation next door to the school, into a three-room service flat.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach in 1968 was closed.
Until then, there were in Kollbach in the school district association of Petershausen-Kollbach three classes and in Petershausen five.
In the school year of 1968/69, these were in Petershausen in today's town hall, accommodated.
When the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded, the only school left was the primary schoolin the locality.
In order for a deranking of position in the now smaller school, to be avoided, the then dean, Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen continued to grow, and so could the children and their teachers, from September 1982 onwards, move into the present-day building, which in 1997 after Richter took his retirement has since been extended.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz, who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work-room and as part of the 1997 extensions extra rooms in the cellar - although the council guidelines governing school-building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work.
"Mayor Götz was a great friend of the school," recalls Richter, with gratitude.
Throughout his whole career, Manfred Richter has never, a reply given in a speech by a government representative, forgot, who had, to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice, responded: "One should never forget to love". Manfred Richter duly implemented what he, as a young teacher, had heard.
"One has to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the now 84 year-old.
And he had to learn: "That doesn't work out always." Whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children, is unclear.
In any case, Richter's methods were at times unconventional.
If school children got into fights, they were not given punishments like, for example, writing out lines or serving a detention.
At the cost of the council, Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves, and then let the two antagonists fight it out, even if this did occasionally produce a black-eye.
For the benefit of the school, Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz (CSU).
Richter, who had no political allegiances, following his retirement, was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council in 1996, as a candidate for the CSU.
However, Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-CYCLE TOUR 700 cyclists are, in the health resort of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten, taking a breather
About touring cyclists in Bad Salzhausen or in Schotten taking a rest, there is nothing particular out of the ordinary.
On Friday, however, the sheer numbers of those resting up was striking: The 700 participants of the hr4 cycle tour, together with their entourages, were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Salzhausen, and later an open air party in the Alteburgpark in Schotten.
Under the logo "Cycling and celebrating along the newly-discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants had on Thursday in Bad Vilbel met up and and had listened to a concert there by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was down to business: The riders set out, the first stage - 60 kilometers via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then further on to Schotten, to attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen-and-women were by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who in Bad Vilbel on his own bike had ridden off the start-line, and the boss of the municipal company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, welcomed.
To refresh body and mind, all sorts of food and drink had been prepared: The local women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had, 85 apple-, plum- and cheesecakes - as well as streusel cake, baked, which the intrepid riders let melt in their mouths.
"Such cakes only the local women can make," praised the rider from Aulendiebach, at the same time as he ordered another slice.
At the drinks stand of the gymnasium club of Geiß-Nidda, the riders could acquire cold drinks.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from Operettas and Musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The lovely atmosphere in the Park had a relaxing effect.
One gentleman even received a head-massage from his lady partner: " He certainly earned it - after all, he had today already a broken bicycle chain re-attached."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company boss still had to work: They were, at the fountain in front of the watering-hole inn, the Trinkkurhaus, by reporter Rainer Janke, interviewed, and took their radio opportunity to give a big thumbs up for Bad Salzhausen.
Even head of promotions, Tobias Hagen, who had worked as tour head since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, could only get a short rest, as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology.
His pick-up truck, in which he used three telephones and a radio, in order with his colleagues and a 15-member motorcycle squad of the police of Hessen, to communicate; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhein-Main-Region," he explained, "but also from Gießen and Fulda, from Lauterbach or from the Taunus and even from many towns in Westfalia riders have come.
The number of participants depends a little on the available accommodation capacity.
In Category 1, the participants will, in hotels, be accommodated, in Category 2, in hostel-style lodging.
As the riders set out again on the road, they had a good impression and happy memories of the resort: "Bye!"
"It was lovely in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved to say goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group could take a short rest.
But then in the evening, the riders were requested to go to the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the guidance of manager of the Schotten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing (GTS) the Park had acquired a lovely festive ambience and, of course, there were plenty of nice nibbles, such as Flammkuchen with well-chilled Federweißer wine, too.
Mayoress Susanne Schaab, GTS-boss, Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairman, Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his capacity as a board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly delighted by the "roaring trade in Schotten."
DJ Tobias Hagen opened the dancing stage.
The opportunity to show off their dancing movements in the open air was, despite their sporting feats on their bicycles, diligently used.
